# Chat with Multiple PDFs using Gemini

This project is a Streamlit-based application that allows users to upload multiple PDF files and interact with them using Google's Gemini AI model. The application extracts text from PDFs, processes it into vector embeddings using FAISS, and enables users to ask questions based on the content of the uploaded documents.

## Features

- Upload multiple PDF files.
- Extract and split text for efficient processing.
- Convert text into embeddings using Google's Generative AI.
- Store and retrieve information using FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search).
- Chat with your PDFs using a conversational AI model.
- Intuitive web interface built with Streamlit.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- pip

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chat-with-multiple-pdfs.git
   cd chat-with-multiple-pdfs
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add:
     ```
     GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
     ```
   - Replace `your_google_api_key_here` with your actual API key.

## Usage

1. **Run the Streamlit app**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
2. **Upload PDFs**:
   - Use the sidebar to upload multiple PDF files.
   - Click the `Submit and Process` button to process the documents.
3. **Ask Questions**:
   - Enter a question related to the uploaded PDFs.
   - The AI model will retrieve relevant information and respond.
